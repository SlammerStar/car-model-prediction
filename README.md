# Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

A machine learning application that predicts car prices based on features like model, year, mileage, and engine size. Built with a user-friendly **Streamlit** interface for easy interaction.


## 🚀 Features

- Predict car prices based on selected features.
- Display model performance metrics.
- Sidebar to select different car brands.
- User-friendly interface for inputting car details.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SlammerStar/car-model-prediction.git
cd car-model-prediction
```

2. **Install required packages**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the Streamlit app:**:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

The app will open in your browser at http://localhost:8501.

## 📈 How It Works

- The app takes inputs such as car brand, model, year, mileage, and engine size.
- The machine learning model (trained on historical car data) predicts the car’s price in USD.
- Results are displayed instantly on the web interface.

## 🧰 Built With

Streamlit
 – For building the web interface
